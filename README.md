# wine-quality-ml-project
This project predicts the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content. Using machine learning models, the system learns patterns from historical wine data to classify or estimate wine quality, helping automate and improve decision-making in food and beverage analysis.
